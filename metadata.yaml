description: "The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911. Timmy\
  \ Tiptoes is a squirrel believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows, and imprisoned\
  \ by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement.\
  \ Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee, a friendly, mischievous chipmunk who has run\
  \ away from his wife and is camping-out in the tree. Chippy urges the prisoner to\
  \ eat the nuts stored in the tree, and Timmy does so but grows so fat he cannot\
  \ escape the tree. He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree.\
  \ The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less\
  \ than harmonious marriage of the chipmunk.\nThe book sold well at release, but\
  \ is now considered one of Potter's weakest productions. Potter never observed the\
  \ tale's indigenous North American mammals in nature, and, as a result, her depictions\
  \ are thought stiff and unnatural. Other elements in the story have come under fire:\
  \ the rhymes, for example, reveal nothing about the characters nor do they provide\
  \ an amusing game for the child reader in the manner of the rhymes in The Tale of\
  \ Squirrel Nutkin. The storm in the finale is viewed as a weak plot device introduced\
  \ solely to hurry the tale to its conclusion, and the marriage of the chipmunks\
  \ has been described as \"abrasive and shocking\" and an impediment to the flow\
  \ of the tale.\nThe tale's disappointing qualities have been ascribed to Potter's\
  \ growing lack of interest in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher\
  \ for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American\
  \ market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children;\
  \ Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American\
  \ fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations\
  \ at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to\
  \ the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some of the reasons\
  \ for the author's declining artistry and her lack of interest in producing children's\
  \ books.\nCharacters from the tale have been reproduced as porcelain figurines,\
  \ enamelled boxes, music boxes, and various ornaments by Beswick Pottery, Crummles,\
  \ Schmid, and ANRI.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
